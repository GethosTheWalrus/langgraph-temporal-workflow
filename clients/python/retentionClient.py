        Subject: PC Build Delayed - Missing GPU Component - Tournament Deadline

        I am extremely frustrated and disappointed. My custom PC build order has been 
        delayed for over 3 weeks due to a missing RTX 4090 GPU. This was supposed to 
        be delivered for a major gaming tournament I am participating in next week.
        
        Customer Details:
        - Gaming enthusiast segment
        - Previously at-risk customer status
        - Has open urgent support ticket about this issue
        - Prefers SMS communication
        - Has spent $3,200+ historically
        
        The delay is affecting my professional gaming preparation and I'm considering:
        1. Cancelling this order and going with a competitor
        2. Downgrading to an available GPU to get the system faster
        3. Demanding significant compensation for the delays
        
        I've been patient but this delay is now affecting my competitive gaming 
        schedule and potential prize money. As a loyal AMD customer who specifically 
        chose your custom build service, this experience is damaging my trust.
        
        I need immediate action: either expedite the GPU or provide alternatives.
        If not resolved by end of week, I will cancel and leave negative reviews.
